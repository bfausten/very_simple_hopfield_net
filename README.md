### This is a very simple hopfield model of size N = 25
It's storing 3 patterns (pictures of a house, a smiley and a cross (x). It correctly recreates the patterns (or their inverses) in the first 20 iterations in roughly 98% of cases.
The project exists only to deepen my understanding of hopfield networks.
